    <p> I enjoy learning new technologies, and I usually try to learn them through personal projects which I do in my free time.
    Here is a list of the most important ones. </p>

      This is an app I am developing for my own use. I love to learn new languages and I needed an app which allows me to store
      the new vocabulary I just learnt. After that I decided to develop the app, so I designed a tool to study the vocabulary stored in
      an efficient way.

      This is my final project for my computer science degree. It is an Android app that automatically identifies
      and record moves played during a Go Game through computer vision techniques. The App can record an entire Go
      game between two players lasting 1 â€“ 2 hours, depending on the battery quality. I had a final mark of 9.3 / 10.

      I wanted to learn how to manage a server, web content and so on. I did not learn anything about this in my degree so
      I had a feeling that I lacked a lot of knowledge on this area. Finally I started this project in which I will try to
      make new content and try new technology related to web development. I would like it to have two main parts:
      First my description and curriculum, along with all data related to it, and second my hobbies, where I can write from time to time,
      like a blog, to practice new languages.
